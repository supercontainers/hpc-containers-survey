# Overview

The HPC Container Community Survey was started in 2024, as an original idea from the [Containers Working Group](https://supercontainers.github.io/containers-wg/ideas/container-technologies-survey/). It strives to be a simple survey that provides insights to container technologies, images, and overall needs and usage for the HPC community.
