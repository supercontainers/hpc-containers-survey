However, once they prove their point, i.e. once their code runs in a given system (local, server, etc), they have little to no incentive to make it easier for others to reproduce their pipeline. Packaging applications into containers are extremely complex for scientists -- even with tools like Docker, they end up wasting a lot of time trying to get it right and ready for deployment. That's the main reason that motivated me to start building ogre.run and the OSS project miniogre (https://github.com/ogre-run/miniogre).
